## **Experience**
**Maths Inst. of Marseille & Fresnel Inst. (CNRS) | 2023/10 - Present**<br>
Doctoral Fellow<br>
Research algorithms for analysing microscopy images of cells in tissue-like environments by overcoming challenges associated with understanding complex molecular processes in these dynamic systems through combining algorithm design with experimental improvements to reduce reliance on *a priori* knowledge of particle movement.

**Maths Inst. of Marseille | 2023/02 - 2023/07**<br>
Research Intern (M.S. Capstone)<br>
Developed ideas to leverage the power of transformers to model the complex patterns and dependencies in fluorescence microscopy data.

**State Univ. of New York (Stony Brook) | 2022/04 - 2022/08**<br>
Research Intern<br>
Developed a transformer-based model for automated analysis of genomic sequences which could learn the grammar and patterns of DNA to uncover functional elements and potential applications.

**Quantiphi Inc. | 2021/01 - 2021/08**<br>
Framework Eng. Intern (B.Tech. Capstone)<br>
Worked in the domain of software development (full-stack development) helping in generating ML/AI solutions for internal clients.

**Indian Inst. of Technology, Patna | 2019/10 - 2019/12**<br>
Research Intern<br>
Developed new computational techniques for gene-clustering using incomplete-multi-omics approaches resulting in a latent space rich in genomic information.

**Calcutta Univ. | 2019/01 - 2019/07**<br>
Research Intern<br>
Comparative study for human activity recognition using deep neural network approaches to simplify the previously used redundant techniques.

**Larsen & Toubro Ltd. | 2018/12 - 2019/01**<br>
Intern at Data Centre<br>
Developed a prototype based on self-organising maps for outlier detection and assisted in handling data by writing simple queries.
