[Skills based CV](https://piyushmishra12.github.io/resume/Piyush%20Mishra%20CV.pdf)

## **Experience**
**Maths Inst. of Marseille & Fresnel Inst. (CNRS) | 10.2023 - Present**<br>
***Doctoral Fellow (Bioimage Mining Group, Turing Centre for Living Systems)***<br>
Research algorithms for analysing microscopy images of cells in tissue-like environments by overcoming challenges associated with understanding complex molecular processes in these dynamic systems through combining algorithm design with experimental improvements to reduce reliance on *a priori* knowledge of particle movement.

**Maths Inst. of Marseille | 02.2023 - 07.2023**<br>
***Research Intern (M.S. Capstone)***<br>
Developed ideas to leverage the power of transformers to model the complex patterns and dependencies in fluorescence microscopy data.

**State Univ. of New York (Stony Brook) | 04.2022 - 08.2022**<br>
***Research Intern***<br>
Developed a transformer-based model for automated analysis of genomic sequences which could learn the grammar and patterns of DNA to uncover functional elements and potential applications.

**Quantiphi Inc. | 01.2021 - 08.2021**<br>
***Framework Eng. Intern (B.Tech. Capstone)***<br>
Worked in the domain of software development (full-stack development) helping in generating ML/AI solutions for internal clients.

**Indian Inst. of Technology, Patna | 10.2019 - 12.2019**<br>
***Research Intern***<br>
Developed new computational techniques for gene-clustering using incomplete-multi-omics approaches resulting in a latent space rich in genomic information.

**Calcutta Univ. | 01.2019 - 07.2019**<br>
***Research Intern***<br>
Comparative study for human activity recognition using deep neural network approaches to simplify the previously used redundant techniques.

**Larsen & Toubro Ltd. | 12.2018 - 01.2019**<br>
***Intern at Data Centre***<br>
Developed a prototype based on self-organising maps for outlier detection and assisted in handling data by writing simple queries.
